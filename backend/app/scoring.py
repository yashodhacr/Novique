"""AI Pulse proprietary scoring engine.

Two independent metrics, each on a 0-100 scale, are the platform's core IP:

  • AI Impact Score  — *How much does this matter?*  A significance measure that
    blends source authority, audience engagement, entity importance, and the
    presence of high-signal events (launches, funding, breakthroughs). It is
    deliberately recency-agnostic: a landmark release stays high-impact for days.

  • AI Trend Score   — *How fast is this rising right now?*  A momentum measure
    driven by engagement velocity (points per hour), a recency boost, and how
    much the item's topics are co-occurring across the current batch.

Both functions are pure and deterministic so they are unit-testable and can be
recomputed offline when weights change. Inputs are plain values, not ORM
objects, to keep the engine decoupled from the database.
